<heapsort>
    is selection sort with a nother data structure
    is used piroirty queue to work 
    
    it's advantage implementation to selection sort O(n^2) to (n logn)s    
    d-th tree 
    has height log base d for n
    <advantage >
      - can be to find largest k value insted of sort the hole array
      - in place and dosnt need extra datastructure 
      - O (nlogn)
      - used insted of quick sort if quick sort has spical slow running time 
    </advantage>
  <DisAdvantage>
    1-use additional storage that used in piriority Queue ==> solved by cnvert given array to heap [ConvertArrayIntoHeap]
  </DisAdvantage>
  <ConvertArrayIntoHeap>
    <buildArray how="by going from down to the top" runningtime=" nlogn">
        int midNode = (array.Length - 1) / 2;
            for (int i = midNode; i >= 0; i--)
            {
                SwiftDown(i);
            }
    </buildArray>
  </ConvertArrayIntoHeap>
  <ConvertMaxHeapToMinHeap>
    swap h[1] ,h[size]
    size--
    siftdown (1)
